# mean-resume
A personal resume website built on the MEAN stack. Perfect for anyone who is just getting started with MEAN, automated testing, database migrations, and source builds.

# Overview
This project accomplishes two main goals:
- Give technically savvy people a quick way to launch a professional resume website.
- Teach MEAN stack basics to rookies. 

During the installation process, you will learn to:
- Fork and clone a Github repository.
- Install Node Package Manager
- Install global packages like MongoDB
- Install dependencies with package.json
- Migrate data into MongoDB
- Build and minify CSS & JS with LESS and Grunt
- Use Package.JSON to start and stop services

You will also be able to read code and learn super-basic concepts like:
- Node app setup
- Node routing
- Mongoose models
- Angular services, controllers, and deferred promises
- Test-driven development

This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of:
- Home brew 
- Git / Github
- Javascript
- CSS
- APIs
- Some sort of database

This guide does not (nor will it ever) address winblows-specific commands. (sorry!).

#Installation

### Fork the code
Click the fork icon and add a copy of this repository to your account. This will allow you to make changes and commit your own personal data for safe keeping. 

### Clone the code
`git clone git@github.com:NoelBaron/mean-resume.git ./`

### Install Global Dependencies
- Make sure Homebrew is installed and in your path. Linux users: [Install Brew](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-linuxbrew-on-a-linux-vps)
- If node is not already installed: `brew install node`
- If mongodb is not already installed: `brew install mongodb` 
- Install Naught `npm install -g naught`
- Install Karma `npm install -g karma`

### Install Local Dependencies (node_modules)
This project does not store modules. Instead, a quick `npm install` will do the trick. Once executed, every package listed in package.json will be installed and all dependencies should be resolved.
